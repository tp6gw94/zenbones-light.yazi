## üé® Installation

<!-- Please replace "username/example" with your repository name. -->

ya pack -a tp6gw94/zenbones-light
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

<!--
Please replace "example" with your flavor name.

If your flavor uses a light color scheme, use "light" instead of "dark" wherever it appears below.
-->

To set it as your dark flavor, change the content of your `theme.toml` to:

```toml
[flavor]
light = "zenbones-light"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.
